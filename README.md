## Introduction
In today's fast-paced software development world, the ability to quickly and efficiently test new features is a game-changer for teams aiming to maintain a competitive edge. Preview Environments serve as the critical testing grounds for new features, bug fixes, and updates before they are integrated into the main codebase. These environments are crafted on-demand to validate specific git branches, providing a transient yet powerful platform for thorough pre-merge testing.

`"Don't merge until you preview" - with Laravel Harbor, ensure that excellence is the standard, not the exception.`
